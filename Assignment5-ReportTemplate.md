## Explain your evaluation and justification of how you decide the MTTFmin
The corresponding visual depiction in Figure 8 indicates that the system's threshold for a satisfactory Mean Time To Failure (MTTF) is 2 time units. This was established by observing where the failure points intersect with the 'accept' boundary on the RDC graph. Figure 9, which presents an MTTF of 1 time unit, places the system predominantly in the 'reject' area, suggesting an insufficient reliability level at this value. Conversely, Figure 10, illustrating an MTTF of 4 time units, demonstrates a conservative estimate, as the system remains within the 'accept' region across the entire duration.

The MTTFmin was determined by utilizing the failure dataset to calculate the average duration between system failures. This was derived by summing the intervals of time and dividing by the accumulated number of failures. The process was aimed at finding a balance between too frequent and too infrequent failure rates that could correspond to the real-world operational demands of the system. The MTTFmin reflects an operational mean, providing a realistic benchmark that aligns with the actual performance trends indicated by the failure data. It acts as a crucial pivot for setting realistic reliability expectations and for framing the subsequent 'what-if' scenarios for the analysis.
